## 2. Experiment Settings and Information
The experiment was conducted on WeatherAirSN-L3. 
To standardize the conditions, we set the time interval for the first version of L3 to 2023.09.01‚Äì2025.07.31. You may also choose to run your experiments on this version.

### 2.1 Research Area
We selected four representative regions across China for comprehensive evaluation:

üèîÔ∏è Lanzhou Urban Agglomeration
- Northwest China
- Characterized by arid climate, complex terrain, and frequent dust events influenced by the Gobi Desert.

üå∫ Kunming Urban Agglomeration
- Southwest China
- Located in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau with mild climate year-round and unique monsoon patterns.

‚ùÑÔ∏è Harbin Urban Agglomeration
- Northeast China
- Features extreme continental climate with harsh winters and significant seasonal variations.

üåä Shanghai
- East Coast
- China's economic hub with subtropical monsoon climate, urban heat island effects, and typhoon influences.

Each region is trained and tested independently to ensure robust regional performance.
### 2.2 Data Split Strategy
Overall ratio - Training:Validation:Test = 7:1:2

Validation Set: Days 1-10 of Oct 2023, Jan/Apr/Jul/Sep/Dec 2024, Mar/Jun 2025

Test Set: Days 14-end of the same months

Training Set: All remaining data

### 2.3 Experimental Setup
- Short-term Prediction

Configuration: 24 steps ‚Üí 1\4\12\24 steps

Evaluation: Lead times at 1h (nowcasting), 4h, 12h, 24h (short-term), and overall performance

- Long-term Prediction

Configuration: 48 steps ‚Üí 1\24\48\72\96\120 steps

Evaluation: Lead times at 1h (nowcasting), 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h (extended range), and overall performance

The training configuration was as follows: maximum epochs were set to 500 with 
an early stopping patience of 30 epochs. We employed the Adam optimizer with an 
initial learning rate of 0.001, coupled with a MultiStepLR scheduler for learning 
rate decay. The batch size was set to 512. All reported results were obtained by 
selecting the checkpoint with the lowest validation loss and evaluating it on the 
held-out test set to ensure unbiased performance assessment.

All experiments were conducted on a single server equipped with 4√ó NVIDIA A100 GPUs, an Intel Xeon Ice Lake processor (32 cores, 64 threads at 2.6GHz), 
and 188GB RAM. The system runs Ubuntu Linux with CUDA 11.7 and PyTorch 1.13.
